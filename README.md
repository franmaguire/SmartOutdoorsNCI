The idea for this project was simple, **Help make weather and travel decisions easier**.  

* The user will select start location
* The user will select end location
* The user will tap end location marker to calculate route
* The application will query google maps with the start and end points
* The API will return a travel time
* The user will select show prediction from menu
* The application will query DARK SKY API with destination point and current time + travel time
* The API will return weather details, this is parsed and displayed on screen for the user to make a decision

## Goal
* Route tracking and recording
* Report emergencies
